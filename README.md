## 🧪 Usage

Double-click `launch_assistant.pyw` (if you're on Windows), or run:

```bash
python my_assistant.py
```

Then say **"chop chop"** to activate the assistant and speak your command.

Say **"shut down"**, **"exit"**, or **"goodbye"** to stop the assistant.

## Troubleshooting

- *Wake word not detected?*  
  Make sure your microphone is active and selected.

- *TTS not working?*  
  Check your system volume and Python `pyttsx3` voice settings.

- *Gemini error?*  
  Make sure your `.env` contains a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
